# Wireless-Obstacle-Detection-and-Mapping-Device

Worked in a team of two and developed a wireless room mapping device using Arduino. Utilized block diagram and software flowchart for initial development. Implemented servo control and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor detection for obstacles ranging up to 4m in 180Â° view using C. Utilized HC-05 Bluetooth module for communication between Arduino (transmitter) and laptop (receiver) using C & Java. Programmed graphical map display with various conditional messages on a laptop screen using Java in Processing IDE.
